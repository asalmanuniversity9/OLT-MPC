# OLT-MPC
OLT-MPC pairs a simple physics model with an online residual learner (sparse GP) to be safe from day one and improve with use. A shrinking “tube” keeps predictions inside constraints: wide when uncertain, tighter as data arrive. Result: certified robustness and steadily better tracking, efficiency, and shorter settling times—on standard hardware.
